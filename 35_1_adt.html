<div aria-label="Environmental issues discussed" class="space-y-4" data-aria-id="aria-35-1-0">
<p data-id="text-35-6">Large cities often have various problems caused by the management of a limited
                    territory where millions of people live.</p>
<p data-id="text-35-7">Air pollution is a serious problem in some cities.</p>
<p data-id="text-35-8">It is caused by the emission of gases from vehicle transit and industries.</p>
<p data-id="text-35-9">Smog is the haze that remains in the city, causing health problems and creating an
                    urban microclimate characterized by increased temperature.</p>
<p data-id="text-35-10">Intense traffic is also a source of noise pollution.</p>
<p data-id="text-35-11">The permanent movement of the population within the city and between it and
                    neighboring cities creates transportation problems.</p>
<p data-id="text-35-12">Many times, transportation systems are not sufficient, which causes congestion and
                    chaos during peak hours.</p>
<p data-id="text-35-13">A large city consumes significant volumes of water, food, and energy.</p>
<p data-id="text-35-14">Similarly, economic activities and households generate thousands of tons of garbage
                    every day, which the city's public services must collect, treat, and deposit at final disposal
                    sites.</p>
<p data-id="text-35-15">The same happens with sewage, which must be channeled through sanitation systems,
                    which do not always exist or are not sufficient.</p>
